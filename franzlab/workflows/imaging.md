3. Click on **Back** (up) to find the highest point of the specimen and **Set Start**.
4. Increase or decrease the **Step Size** to get around 20 steps for lateral view and 15 for dorsal view.
5. Change the intensity of flashes if necessary (5-5.5 for 3x-5x magnification, 2-4 for 1x-3x magnification, just try what looks best).
6. On the **upper right corner of EOS 6D**, click on the round button to get a sample image.
